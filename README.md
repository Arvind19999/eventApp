# eventApp
Here i have created eventApp with database name "appevent" using XAMPP with table name "listevent" having 6 fields
id, title, description, place, startDate, endDate where all data are arranged in ascending order of startDate. Delete functionality is 
added using "ajax". Various filtering options are also provided, they are
1) Upcoming Events
2) Finished Events
3) Upcoming Events within 7 days
4) Finished Events in past 7 days.

and also past event automatically goes to finished event record..
